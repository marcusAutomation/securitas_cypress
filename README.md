## : goal_net: Goals
- keep it simple - no 'custom' abstractions/functions/utils/helpers (use what Cypress provides)
- tests are easily readable
- project is easily understandable even to people without previous JS or Cypress knowledge
- [use shortcuts](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#4-Skip-your-UI-as-much-as-possible) to avoid repeating/testing the same UI actions over and over again
